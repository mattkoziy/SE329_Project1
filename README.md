# SE329_Project1

Synopsis

Our project is designed for teachers who have difficulty remembering studentâ€™s names. Often teachers can be overwhelmed with the number of students in the class and have a hard time making connections and putting names to faces. Our iOS application in combition with the Wikitude augmented reality framework allows the teacher to simply just point and shoot to remember a student's name.

Code Example

Installation

Download the xcode project file onto a Mac. Next, there will most likely be some code signing issues and some possible project configuration- this should be very minimal configuration. Finally install the app onto a mobile iPhone device.
